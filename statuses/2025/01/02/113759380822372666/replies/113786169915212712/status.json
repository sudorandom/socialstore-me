  "content": "\u003cp\u003eThis is a hard question. I\u0026#39;ve learned that I can, indeed, keep up my cycling. There\u0026#39;s a lot of freedom that comes with being able to quickly get places without a car. In Copenhagen it\u0026#39;s often fastest to use a bike to go places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I also learned my limit when it comes to language learning. Danish has been really tough for me... and I think a lot of my issues come from the classroom setting. I have a lot of stress and anxiety associated with it. I\u0026#39;m looking into other ways to get more practice and learning. I\u0026#39;m not stopping my learning, and, in fact, I feel the most comfortable with the language as I ever have. More words and phrases feel familiar and natural. I can make some more complex sentences sometimes. My vocabulary is steadily growing due to my usage of language apps (drops, duo lingo and babble). I\u0026#39;ll get there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI learned that health is more than just exercise. I have needed to make adjustments to my diet for a long while. I have started to do that.\u003c/p\u003e",
