  "content": "\u003cp\u003eBe warned, this is an incomplete thought.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main issue I see with news, social media and any content platform is that the way feeds are curated give an enormous power to the entity doing the curation. You can completely miss out on a creator that you’ve subscribed to on YouTube because Google thinks you just don’t want to see them anymore. News sites will bias to show you the most sensational headlines. Social media will bias towards what gets the most clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMastodon is one of the few platforms that seems to give enough access to be able to filter and sort your own content in the way you want…. But this still seems like a hard problem to solve for everyone. Not everyone will want to put in the work it takes to curate a follower list that will give them the right amount of depressing news articles (so you know what’s going on in the world) with content that’s more kind to your mental health. And even fewer people will want to run custom tooling that consumes a firehose of data and filters for high quality content. These are hard problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some things that help: newsletters, personal blogs, link sharing networks, follower lists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wish it were easier to get a more complete overview of an article or piece of news. The fragmented architecture of the Internet is amazing for scaling but it also makes it very hard to track all of the commentary and critique. But do note… I don’t care what everyone says on every topic. But if there’s someone who has written several peer reviewed papers on a specific topic mentioned in an article, I want to see them. I want to hear them. I want experts to be promoted again, not just generic talking heads.\u003c/p\u003e",
