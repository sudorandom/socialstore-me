Time frame was late '60s, early '70s - when in-band signaling was in use for phone equipment on one end of the wire to tell the equipment on the other end what was happening. (Like sounds made when a coin was dropped into a pay phone.)  DTMF was used for long distance network signaling starting around 1959.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 2600Hz tone was used by the local central office to tell the equipment on the remote end that the call had finished.\u003cbr\u003eThe hack was that if you played a 2600 Hz tone into a phone that was making a long distance call, the far end would hang up and the near end would not - you could then use a special DTMF box that generated network tones (not the same pairs that later were used by touch tone phones, but the same idea - network DTMF was decades earlier) to dial a new number on the far end.  By timing the disconnect correctly, you could make the remote calls without the local end generating any billing information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLots of link rot if you go searching for exact details.\u003c/p\u003e",
