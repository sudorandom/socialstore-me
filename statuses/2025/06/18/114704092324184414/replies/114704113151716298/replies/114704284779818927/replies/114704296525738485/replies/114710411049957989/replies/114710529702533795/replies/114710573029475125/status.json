I guess the disconnect tone caused the billing clock to stop, or maybe you had to call some toll-free or reserved system number to then disconnect and make a free call.  (In the US, the last four digits \"99xy\" were reserved by COs for things like \"silence\", \"busy\", \"ringtone\", \"ringback\", \"time\", etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hand-held DTMF concept wound up being adopted by alternate long-distance providers in the US and other countries - if you wanted to use an alternate carrier, you had to touch-tone in some codes, but couldn't do so if you had a dial phone or were on a dial payphone, so you could get a hand-held tone generator to put against the handset's microphone.  You could then use Sprint or MCI or whomever as your long distance provider by tone dialing the proper numbers. Some of those units had memory so you could just push one button to send the provider selection and your account number with one press, then dial the number you wanted on the little keypad.  (Of course, those DTMF tones were the \"Touch Tone\" frequencies, different pairs from the \"Network\" tones.)\u003c/p\u003e",
