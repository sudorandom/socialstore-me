Doing this decreased the amount of time each call took on the trunk line because rotary dialing took time. (As a side note, in the US, the \"Area Codes\" - three digits, x0y or x1y - were selected so that large areas (NY - 212, LA - 213, Chicago - 312) were \"Low Dial Pull\",  so it took less time than dialing Oklahoma - 405.  This saved the users' time, but not time on the trunks.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen DTMF was used for long distance redialing, there needed to be a way to signal the remote side that the local side had hung up.  Two different tones were used for that, the \"Caller Hang Up\" was 2600 Hz, dunno what the \"Receiver Hang Up\" was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe whole \"Phone Phreaking\" thing in the '70s was about figuring out what was going on with the tones, and how they could be generated by individuals to control the network.  One story is that the whole thing started because someone was playing electronic music to a friend on a long distance call, and anytime they played a certain piece, the call would drop.  They spoke to someone knowledgeable at the phone company, and was told about the disconnect tones, so any reasonably clean 2600Hz tone for a quarter-second or so would disconnect the far end of the call, leaving the near end still attached to the trunk line.\u003c/p\u003e",
