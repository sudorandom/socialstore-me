The thing is that DTMF was in use for decades before that for central office-to-central office signalling - by the time Touch-Tone phones were introduced, DTMF was a very mature technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the start of dial/disconnect calling, connections between distant central offices still required operator intervention (\"Long Distance Calling\").  After a while, the trunking system was automated - for example, there might have been 100 physical pairs run between two large cities, and calls were placed on them automatically, with the first few numbers dialed causing a trunk selection, and the remaining numbers being sent over the trunk to dial the destination line at the far end.   There were different busy signals for \"destination line in use\" and \"no trunk available\" - in the US, those were slow busy and fast busy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever there was more information that needed to be sent along the trunk line than could be encoded in just the clicks - that's where DTMF came in, it wasn't originally intended for home use at all.  Various sorts of billing and logistics information could be sent along with a call - eventually the dial pulses would be captured locally, the trunk assigned, and the number re-transmitted via network DTMF to the far end.  This kept the trunk from having to be held while the user dialed and dialed - much more time-efficient.\u003c/p\u003e",
