My company had a layoff so a lot of stuff needs to be figured out... but other than that, I\u0026#39;m probably being a bit too ambitious. The things I gravitate towards are \u0026quot;Let\u0026#39;s improve WebTransport\u0026quot;. I mean, my articles start out as \u0026quot;Here\u0026#39;s a simple idea showing off the tech\u0026quot; and it quickly morphs into \u0026quot;Oh god, it\u0026#39;s totally broken and not ready for prime time. Can I improve it? Let\u0026#39;s improve it for the article!\u0026quot; And then a month has past and I have nothing real to show for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, I\u0026#39;m going to publish an article with an unsatisfactory ending. It will end with \u0026quot;Hm. This idea doesn\u0026#39;t actually work right now\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e",
