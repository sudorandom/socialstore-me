  "content": "\u003cp\u003eThis is a hard one. It seems crazy to me with how AI is being sold to people. I very much thought that it would hollow out many companies before being sold as a product. I\u0026#39;m concerned at the speed of change here.. but also I do feel like there\u0026#39;s a lot lacking on current AI products. It will try to make the user happy so biases will be re-enforced instead of challenges. Both AI themselves and the people using it can fall into a psychosis filled with imagined truths about the world. I feel like this is dangerous, especially when you consider the fact that LLMs do NOT \u0026quot;think\u0026quot;. Yes, even when you tell it to think, it is only guessing at appropriate output for the given context and input. This process, I believe, is very different from general AI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we already tainted the internet... But to be fair, AI written news articles have been a thing for much longer than the current LLM hype cycle. I\u0026#39;m now wondering if it\u0026#39;s possible to undo the damage to humanity\u0026#39;s knowledge base.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yes, I think everyone is responsible for what will come from AI. Particularly those who are trying to cash in on the bubble.\u003c/p\u003e",
