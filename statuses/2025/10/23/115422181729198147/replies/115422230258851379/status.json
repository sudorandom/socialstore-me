Then a phase of wanting to do neither. I do maintain a decent level of productivity but I try not to force it. I\u0026#39;m bad about this sometimes though where I will feel guilt in the amount of work that I\u0026#39;m producing... but I try to remind myself that productivity cycles are normal. I\u0026#39;m already doing well above what is required.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, if you do start feeling apathetic and/or exhausted from your life or work, try to give yourself some grace where you can. You might have goals and dreams, but remember that if you burn yourself out then those don\u0026#39;t matter. Do what you need to do to live today so that you can thrive tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e",
