    "description": "A great milestone for Tampnet was reached on Tuesday March 30 with the closing of the transaction with BP. The acquisition of the BP Gulf of Mexico (GoM) fibre network replicates Tampnetâ€™s position in the North Sea. It cements the companyâ€™s ambitions and willingness to invest in GoM and confirms its position as the leading telecommunications provider in the basin.\n\nAfter having received regulatory and governmental approvals a couple of weeks ago, all documents were signed and the transaction completed at noon CET Tuesday March 30. The agreement with BP was signed in July 2020.",
