She is currently in her 2nd year of uni here in Honolulu studying astrophysics. Sheâ€™s talking about doing her masters in Denmark (for free!) but I suspect she might end up in Australia as thatâ€™s the place we all miss.\u003cbr\u003eIâ€™m with you all the way on billionaires, no society should allow anyone to have that much money. I loved having my 12 month paid maternity leave in Denmark and never gave the cost of healthcare a second thought. I think the only reason weâ€™re still in the US is because we know that we can always return to Denmark. \u003cbr\u003eDanish must be so hard to learn. We stuck with speaking Danish at home when we first moved to Australia to make sure our daughter wouldnâ€™t forget. \u003cbr\u003eMen jeg er sikker pÃ¥ at du nok skal lÃ¦re det:)\u003c/p\u003e",
