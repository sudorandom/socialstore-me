I mean, that’s none of my business so you obviously don’t have to share that. Just curious. Do you think you’ll stay in Denmark then? Let me know if you need any tips, Danes can be a bit hard to read for foreigners but most of us are nice deep down. \u003cbr\u003eWe moved to DFW from Sydney where we lived for 8 years. That was our biggest mistake ever. Not to insult the place you’re from but moving to North Texas suburbia from Sydney was not our smartest move (we’re liberal, atheists, anti gun and worst of all vegetarians 😂) and we were isolated even before the pandemic. Anyway, thanks to the pandemic we had struggled leaving the US so we moved as far away as possible and now live in Honolulu🏝\u003c/p\u003e",
