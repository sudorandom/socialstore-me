I think I share way more values with Danes than I ever did with a rural Texan. Culturally there are some fun differences but it is blunted a bit by Copenhagen being so multinational anyway. I love biking to work, not having to own a car to get places, the food is generally higher quality (but I do miss good TexMex foodâ€¦.). My daughter is way ahead of us on learning and speaking Danish. At 3 years old itâ€™s crazy how well kids can pick up languages. Weâ€™re trailing behind a bit, as we probably always will. Texas appears to get both hotter and colder than Denmarkâ€¦ although the cold is usually short-lived. Denmarkâ€™s weather is consistent in temperature and the fact that it is likely to rain on most days with little notice. Life is generally good. I love living in Copenhagen.\u003c/p\u003e",
