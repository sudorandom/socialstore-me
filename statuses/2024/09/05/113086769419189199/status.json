The longer you are at a job, the more notice your employer has to give you before terminating you. For example, my employers need to give me 3 months of notice if they wish to terminate my employment. The lowest amount of notice is 1 month, which makes sense after you know that the traditional pay period here is once a month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter that, there\u0026#39;s a kind of unemployment system. It really does feel nice to be treated like a human. It takes time to line up another job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnions are very popular and powerful here. I\u0026#39;m sure that has nothing to do with this! /s\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://boundlesshq.com/guides/denmark/end-of-employment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" translate=\"no\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"invisible\"\u003ehttps://\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ellipsis\"\u003eboundlesshq.com/guides/denmark\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"invisible\"\u003e/end-of-employment/\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
