  "content": "\u003cp\u003eOh my. I used to be on a team that focused on investigating new technology. We dog-fooded our own platforms a lot and just generally improved things. Now I have to be vague, but I\u0026#39;ve made something really cool, and it got the higher-ups really excited and it probably led to a launch of a much bigger initiative. That initiative ultimately failed, horribly, for a number of reasons. I\u0026#39;m not exactly sure what \u0026quot;the lesson\u0026quot; was, but I think I learned a lot about how to interact with C-levels. They will imagine something extremely different, so you have to consider that when presenting things.\u003c/p\u003e",
