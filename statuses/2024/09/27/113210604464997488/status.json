It seems like several different technologies are showing a lot of promise. Thorium-based nuclear power plants seem to be making real progress mixed with molten salt reactors are also super interesting. Fusion reactors, obviously, are super exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince I live in Denmark I feel obliged to be excited for offshore wind farms and \u0026quot;energy islands\u0026quot;. Mixing this technology with biofuel could seriously improve the carbon impact of global cargo shipping, which I doubt we\u0026#39;ll move away from anytime soon.any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, there\u0026#39;s many more but I really do wish we\u0026#39;d make some significant progress on carbon reduction. Carbon capture is likely needed but I feel like we\u0026#39;re a long way off before removal is cheaper than just reducing the emission of carbon to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e",
