Then I walk away or switch to something else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time I\u0026#39;ve gotten to be very good at knowing what to do to discover the source of problems. There\u0026#39;s often tooling that helps with this but also there\u0026#39;s no replacement for understanding things at a deeper level. At first everything seems like magic, but as you learn more and more the magic gets pushed out and replaced with solid understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, if the world no longer makes sense when you\u0026#39;re debugging you have to start questioning your assumptions. That would probably be my best piece advice of general debugging advice.\u003c/p\u003e",
