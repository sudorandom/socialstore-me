  "content": "\u003cp\u003eThe most effective standups, in my experience, was having a dedicated slack channel where everyone would post a daily message (a bot would emind everyone). Often times you would see some followup questions in a thread branching off of each person\u0026#39;s message. This allowed for natural tangents and collaboration when it was needed without wasting everyone\u0026#39;s time. From there discussion can be carried onto other slack channels or meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve seen where standups are all done in a single slack thread (like my current job) and I don\u0026#39;t like it too much because it doesn\u0026#39;t promote the same amount of discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s important here is that there was a culture of this being a required and important thing... and I think the ability to reply directly to a message is important.\u003c/p\u003e",
