  "content": "\u003cp\u003eA few days a week I commute to work on my bike after dropping my daughter off at school. We\u0026#39;re easily a 5 minute walk from school but my daughter still likes to take her bike. I ride through some nice areas of the city, including over a pedestrian and cycling bridge and through the middle of The Black Diamond, which is a wonderful and interesting piece of architecture sitting alongside the Copenhagen harbor. I continue to ride alongside the harbor until I reach my workplace, which is super close to Kongens Nytorv, a popular spot nearby the city center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile riding I sometimes listen to music while I take in the sights and sounds but usually I listen to podcasts or an audio book. The ride only lasts 15-20 minutes so I don\u0026#39;t get a ton of listening time in though. The most rewarding part of the journey is to just see the city. See other people going to work, see tourists being absolutely clueless, see people relaxing alongside the harbor, see evidence of future events that will happen later that evening, see people stripping nude and jumping into the harbor in the cold winter, and really it just feels like you\u0026#39;re a part of the city. I really do think that it\u0026#39;s very different from driving a car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other days I work from home. The commute isn\u0026#39;t much to talk about but I sure do enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e",
