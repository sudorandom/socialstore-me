  "content": "\u003cp\u003eI really like how AI is portrayed in Pandora\u0026#39;s Star and the rest of the Commonwealth Saga. The AI, referred to as SI (sentient intelligence) is obviously a sentient being and has colonized a planet (that humans know of) but other than offering some services and basically contracting computing power for companies and governments it is mostly hands off from human affairs. It appears to mostly appreciate gaining more knowledge about the universe so areas where it cannot adventure (like in places where human technology doesn\u0026#39;t work) it appreciates the aide of humans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI just really appreciate the world building done in that series. There\u0026#39;s definitely a sense of unease between the SI and humans but there is still a sense of mutual benefit. It comes up in subtle ways by different characters. It\u0026#39;s just so interesting!\u003c/p\u003e",
