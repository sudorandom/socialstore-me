This applies to everything but is especially true of indieweb. I feel like you\u0026#39;re not really feeling it unless you are publishing something of yourself. I think reasonably priced hosts like omg.lol  help a good deal with reducing the \u0026quot;time till first expression\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, I do think there are countless numbers of people that put out a little nugget of themselves into the internet and are passed over. I wish there were a better way to find those moments because they can mean the difference between a lifetime of hyper-involved community members and people that pass by with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e",
