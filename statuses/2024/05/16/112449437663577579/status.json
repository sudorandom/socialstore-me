  "content": "\u003cp\u003eMy current read on HTTP/3 is that it is the epitome of the William Gibson quote \u0026quot;The future is already here â€“ itâ€™s just not very evenly distributed\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHTTP/3 solves some very real issues with HTTP/2 (more on that later). Browser support is already really good but it\u0026#39;s so strange to me that developer tooling seems so far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- I have to use a custom build of curl to use http3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- gRPC, a protocol known for pushing the world into HTTP/2 is flailing on committing to support HTTP/3 (except for, apparently, C#).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet 30% of web traffic is being served with HTTP/3. What the actual fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI totally understand that quic and HTTP/3 are a big undertaking but it\u0026#39;s just confusing how browsers, CDNs and load balancers can move so fast but some incredibly important tooling lags behind. Except for browsers, how do people test HTTP/3 endpoints?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHTTP/3 does solve a lot of problems for browsers and the web experience, but, for me, I am really excited at the possibility of using HTTP/3 to solve issues with gRPC (both in the frontend with gRPC-Web and the backend). I\u0026#39;ve had real issues with head-of-line blocking in the past and I really want the unambiguous solution to be adopting HTTP/3. I\u0026#39;m just a little restless because this all seems so close~~~\u003c/p\u003e",
