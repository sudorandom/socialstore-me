I\u0026#39;ve written and published some very well-received blog posts, I\u0026#39;ve taken a vacation with my family: half the time in Sweden and half around my home city, Copenhagen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve learned to prepare more of a backlog of blog posts for vacations. I had far less \u0026quot;free time\u0026quot; than I imagined, but I still wanted to keep up with my weekly blog post so I made a few softer blog posts about my move to Denmark. It\u0026#39;s much easier to write about those kinds of subjects for me.\u003c/p\u003e",
