  "content": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m not going to lie, I\u0026#39;ve been burning myself out a bit. I\u0026#39;ve been contributing to a few open source projects including trailers support for http3 in go-quic, http3 support for buf, and examples support for protovalidate. I\u0026#39;ve also made a new project that involved a pretty amazing amount of protobuf reflection magic in FauxRPC. I still have an ongoing series of re-creating HTTP from scratch, which I\u0026#39;ve gotten a little bit overwhelmed by, so I\u0026#39;ve slowed the cadence on that for a bit. All of that with my weekly blog schedule. A lot of this work was originally driven by my writing, which I\u0026#39;m super thankful for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of this was happening when I was having more parental duties due to an enhanced work schedule from my wife.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOh and I also have a day job, where on top of my normal duties gave a talk to our organization about some of the architectural changes we\u0026#39;ve been making, with all of the deep tech details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll that to say, I still want to keep my weekly posting schedule but I think I\u0026#39;m going to do some smaller-in-scope articles to keep it simple. I think I\u0026#39;ve missed enough with my broader topics that I think I need to step back a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#39;t promise anything, but I do have some content for \u0026quot;gRPC: The Ugly Parts\u0026quot; that I need to flesh out. It\u0026#39;s a toss up between that and two other simpler ideas for this next week.\u003c/p\u003e",
