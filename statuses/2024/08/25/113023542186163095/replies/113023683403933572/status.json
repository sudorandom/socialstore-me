If you're unhappy with your work/life balance and your direct manager and immediate team aren't on board with fixing that, you're fighting an uphill battle and will likely ultimately lose.\u003cbr\u003e- Force yourself to take your PTO such that you don't lose any during the \"rollover\" at the end of the year. If you have \"sick days\" or \"personal days\" (that do not accrue across years like vacation), this is *especially* important. You're effectively throwing money away if you don't take the time for yourself; it's part of your total compensation.\u003cbr\u003e- If your team cannot afford you taking time off, your manager isn't doing their job, and that is *not* your problem. You may need to coordinate with others for \"coverage,\" but outside of that, *you* should decide when you take time off.\u003c/p\u003e",
