  "content": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve had a very nice career so far. I\u0026#39;ve been lucky enough to work for a cloud company (before it was named that) and see an entire industry arise. I\u0026#39;ve had an amazing Job at Apple, working on one of the larger networks on earth. I\u0026#39;ve been able to leverage my experience and skills to move my family across an ocean to Denmark and currently have a job working backend services for a very popular mobile game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0026#39;m most proud that I have maintained my interest in learning. Initially, I was concerned with this career because it\u0026#39;s said that you have to keep learning. That was pitched to me as a downside of this career but I feel like it\u0026#39;s a strength.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m also proud of my progress with my writing lately and I\u0026#39;m glad that many others are reading (and benefiting) from it. Literally one person that says that they got something out of it makes all of this effort worth it.\u003c/p\u003e",
