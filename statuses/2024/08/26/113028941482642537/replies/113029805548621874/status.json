  "content": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m still really excited for the reach my blog has gotten. My consistent writing hasn\u0026#39;t been easy but if I go back and read the earlier posts from oldest to most recent I see a dramatic improvement in technical depth, writing style, length, focus, etc. My recent posts are dramatically better, in my opinion. So back to the question, I\u0026#39;m excited about many of the ideas that I still have. I\u0026#39;m excited to jump into websockets, the guts of HTTP/2, QUIC and HTTP/3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m also excited to expand what I\u0026#39;m doing with protoc-gen-connect-openapi. OpenAPI has in-app documentation tooling, so why can\u0026#39;t protobuf?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd with FauxRPC, I\u0026#39;m excited to flesh the project out. I need to write a few articles showing how to use it as a Go library, set up stub responses, and start work on some new features. I have an idea of writing a protobuf editor that instantly makes a mock server as you type the protobuf. If that wasn\u0026#39;t enough, I also want to make something that takes a set of stub requests and responses in JSON and generates protobuf out of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m also excited to get trailer support finished for servers in quic-go. I think it\u0026#39;s in a pretty good state, but still needs more reviewing. I know there are parallel efforts for implementing QUIC into the Go standard library but it\u0026#39;s super exciting to be the one to first enable gRPC over HTTP/3 in Go.\u003c/p\u003e",
