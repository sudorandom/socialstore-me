  "content": "\u003cp\u003eI was once on a project where we made literally every mistake. We used an inappropriate programming language, an inappropriate type of database, a cutting-edge and largely untested async framework. We didn\u0026#39;t have proper guidelines or linting rules so as time crunch occurred to get the product released quality fell, drastically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI learned so much from that product... but in the end, it actually was a very stable product and required very little maintenance right up until the day that it was sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously I am being vague about what the product does because I am not proud of my work there. I learned a lot about taking ownership of the entire process of software development, not just the code. I learned that I couldn\u0026#39;t always 100% trust the most senior engineer. He needed me to pushback earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that saved us was that I invested time and effort creating a comprehensive functional test suite that gave us much more confidence in the product. Quite literally we would have definitely shipped broken code several times without that test suite.\u003c/p\u003e",
