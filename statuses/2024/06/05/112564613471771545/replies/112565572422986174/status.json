There's a tool that has \"points\" you can award to someone. The points actually get paid out as dollars once a year. When you award points, you can say why you're awarding them and specify a group of people to award them to. It's been a good way to incentivize positive feedback. There are some restrictions (contractors can't award points but can leave positive feedback) but overall the system works well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther companies I've worked at have tried various things to incentivize positive feedback, but I haven't seen anything as effective as the system above. A good company culture for positive feedback is also key here; if it doesn't come from the top, it doesn't happen.\u003c/p\u003e",
