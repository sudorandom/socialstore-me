  "content": "\u003cp\u003e1. My wife: shes my partner and best friend and has always done so much for me.\u003cbr /\u003e2. My daughter: She\u0026#39;s extremely amazing and I feel lucky enough to witness her grow up.\u003cbr /\u003e3. Ability to move to Denmark. For most people it seems insane for a family of Texans to move to Denmark with no other family or social roots but it has been an amazing move. It is sometimes very challenging but we\u0026#39;ve gained so much from the move.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor anyone considering making a similar move, being in a different country doesn\u0026#39;t suddenly change you. You have to be willing to put in work to change yourself. I learned how to ride a bike, walk more than I ever have in my life, am learning Danish, was obsessed with cultural differences that might become issues for a couple years (that definitely fades over time as you adapt to things). I think the attitude you bring into this really matters. All of your problems will still be there. Okay, I\u0026#39;m going to make a long-form post about this. I\u0026#39;ll shut up about this for now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. I\u0026#39;m super thankful that I appear to still be good at software engineering. It has enabled an absolutely insane lifestyle while living in the United States and the capital for us to relocate countries without a lot of worry about money or job opportunities. I do, often, feel like an imposter but I feel like as long as I keep fearlessly tackling the unknown I will keep my skills sharp enough for whatever will come.\u003c/p\u003e",
